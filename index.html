                    This module covered problem-solving skills, programming basics and object-oriented concepts,
                    modelling and programming. The main language learnt in this module was Java.
                    Practical skills were reinforced through a range of exercises and assignments covering these
                    topics.

                    This module explored various aspects of data storage, processing and analysis. Programming skills
                    were reinforced through a range of exercises and practicals covering various aspects of data handling.
                    Topics include: persistent data formats; files and databases; file manipulation; binary and
                    textual data; data processing using open source libraries; database design and use;
                    object-relational mapping frameworks; processing and analysing data; issues of scale.
                    Themes related to current research in the area of data science and big data were emphasised.

                <h3>Programming Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    This module reinforced key Java programming skills gained earlier, by means of a series of
                    coursework assignments posed as mini-projects within small groups. These projects were designed to offer
                    increasing depth and scope for creativity as the module progressed.

                <p>
                    This module introduced me to the Internet and the World Wide Web from a Computer Science perspective.
                    It consisted of two complementary streams: computer networks and web-based computing.
                    Both streams introduce key concepts, current technologies, programming abstractions and the
                    practical aspects of developing web-based and network applications.

                <h3>Advanced Programming Projects</h3>
                <p>
                    This module introduced the functional and dynamic programming paradigms, using languages such as
                    Haskell and Python. Understanding was reinforced through multiple group projects.
